Subject:

The game is made up of two lists of numbers named l_a and l_b.
In the beginning, l_b will be empty and l_a will contain a certain amount of positive or negative numbers.
The objective of the game is to sort l_a.

In order to accomplish this, you will only have access to the following operation:
• sa

swap the first two elements of l_a (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements).
• sb

swap the first two elements of l_b (nothing will happen if there aren’t enough elements).
• sc

sa and sb at the same time.
• pa
take the first element from l_b and move it to the first position on the l_a list (nothing will happen if
l_b is empty).

• pb
take the first element from l_a and move it to the first position on the l_b list (nothing will happen if
l_a is empty).

• ra
rotate l_a toward the beginning, the first element will become the last.

• rb
rotate l_b toward the beginning, the first element will become the last.

• rr
ra and rb at the same time.

• rra
rotate l_a toward the end, the last element will become the first.

• rrb
rotate l_b toward the end, the last element will become the first.

• rrr
rra and rrb at the same time.

You must create a program in which l_a is given as parameter (all numbers are valid and can fit in an integer).
The goal is to sort the list by using the fewest possible operations.
The program must print the series of operations that enable this list to be sorted.
